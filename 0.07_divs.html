				<p>Four years have passed since the mortal races stood together against the might of the Burning Legion. The tenuous peace forged in a time of desperation is fading. Arthas, the mad deathknight, has assumed the mantle of the Lich King, becoming nearly invincible in his fortress in Northrend. However, the great will of the Lich King has failed, and the undead legions have splintered. The Forsaken, those creatures that have managed to throw off the control of the undead lord under the guidance of Sylvanas Windrunner, the former high elf, have control of the lands of Lordaeron, under constant attack from the mindless creations of the Arthas. South of Lordaeron, in the land of Azeroth, the humans have reclaimed their stronghold of Stormwind, building it into their new capital city. But the king has mysteriously vanished, and the Defias Brotherhood, a group of thieves and murderers, have gained considerable power. With the Stormwind army away from the capital, the task falls on the shoulder of adventurers to protect the human lands, under the rule of their child king.</p>

				<p>To the north of Stormwind, in Khaz Modan, the dwarves and gnomes work together, trying to reclaim the gnomish city of Gnomeregan from the troggs, while attempting to secure their own borders and protect their human allies. In Darnassus, the island stronghold of the Night Elves, nature and balance have been restored, but the mainland of Kalimdor has been lost to the Horde. In Ogrimmar, to the south of Darnassus, the orcs and trolls attempt to carve out their own place in a world that does not seem to want them, under the wise leadership of the shaman Thrall. In Southern Kalimdor, the Tauren try to protect their great city of Thunder Bluff from the ravages of those who would attempt to defile their lands. Eight races, all vying for control of Azeroth. Four years have passed since the races banded together to protect the Well of Eternity from the power of the Burning Legion. The tenuous peace that once held all the hatred of the races at bay, has shattered. The lands of the world of Azeroth have once again become host to a World of Warcraft.</p>

			<p> Warcraft: Orcs and Humans - For ages, the fallen titan Sargeras plotted to scour all life from Azeroth. To this end, Sargeras possessed the human sorcerer Medivh and compelled him to contact Gul'dan, an orc warlock on the world of Draenor. There, Sargeras' demonic servants among the Burning Legion worked to corrupt the once - peaceful orcs and forge them into a bloodthirsty army known as the Horde. This cursed force invaded Azeroth through the Dark Portal, a dimensional gateway created by Medivh and Gul'dan, and clashed with the human nation of Stormwind. Aided by the half-orc Garona, human champions like Anduin Lothar fought valiantly to protect their kingdom. Yet, in the end, the mighty Horde shattered Stormwind's defenses. Amid the city's tragic fall, Garona betrayed her allies and assassinated King Llane Wrynn, sealing the nation's defeat. </p>
